Goal: capture BK screen for sending it to the host PC over UART

BK pixel clock = 12 MHz

Fields are 318 lines, 15625 Hz approx, 50 fields/sec

In B&W mode, 512x256
In RGB mode, 256x256

RGB can be calculated from B&W bits if they're captured properly.

SPI hardware shifts in the bits
DMA stores them in SRAM
Master clock has to be 72Mhz (12x6)

For 3x oversampled input: 1 line = 512*3/8 = 192 bytes, times 256 lines = 49152 bytes 

1 frame = 16384 bytes
