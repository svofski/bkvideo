// function.  You should modify these callback functions to take appropriate actions for each of these
// conditions.  For example, in the USBCBSuspend(), you may wish to add code that will decrease power
// consumption from Vbus to <2.5mA (such as by clock switching, turning off LEDs, putting the

// add code that undoes the power saving things done in the USBCBSuspend() function.

// The USBCBSendResume() function is special, in that the USB stack will not automatically call this

 *
 * Overview:        The USB specifications allow some types of USB
 * 					peripheral devices to wake up a host PC (such
 *					as if it is in a low power suspend to RAM state).
 *					This can be a very useful feature in some
 *					USB applications, such as an Infrared remote
 *					control	receiver.  If a user presses the "power"
 *					button on a remote control, it is nice that the
 *					IR receiver can detect this signalling, and then
 *					send a USB "command" to the PC to wake up.
 *					
 *					The USBCBSendResume() "callback" function is used
 *					to send this special USB signalling which wakes 
 *					up the PC.  This function may be called by
 *					application firmware to wake up the PC.  This
 *					function will only be able to wake up the host if
 *                  all of the below are true:
 *					
 *					1.  The USB driver used on the host PC supports
 *						the remote wakeup capability.
 *					2.  The USB configuration descriptor indicates
 *						the device is remote wakeup capable in the
 *						bmAttributes field.
 *					3.  The USB host PC is currently sleeping,
 *						and has previously sent your device a SET 
 *						FEATURE setup packet which "armed" the
 *						remote wakeup capability.   
 *
 *                  If the host has not armed the device to perform remote wakeup,
 *                  then this function will return without actually performing a
 *                  remote wakeup sequence.  This is the required behavior, 
 *                  as a USB device that has not been armed to perform remote 
 *                  wakeup must not drive remote wakeup signalling onto the bus;
 *                  doing so will cause USB compliance testing failure.
 *                  
 *					This callback should send a RESUME signal that
 *                  has the period of 1-15ms.
 *
 * Note:            This function does nothing and returns quickly, if the USB
 *                  bus and host are not in a suspended condition, or are 
 *                  otherwise not in a remote wakeup ready state.  Therefore, it
 *                  is safe to optionally call this function regularly, ex: 
 *                  anytime application stimulus occurs, as the function will
 *                  have no effect, until the bus really is in a state ready
 *                  to accept remote wakeup. 
 *
 *                  When this function executes, it may perform clock switching,
 *                  depending upon the application specific code in 
 *                  USBCBWakeFromSuspend().  This is needed, since the USB
 *                  bus will no longer be suspended by the time this function
 *                  returns.  Therefore, the USB module will need to be ready
 *                  to receive traffic from the host.
 *
 *                  The modifiable section in this routine may be changed
 *                  to meet the application needs. Current implementation
 *                  temporary blocks other functions from executing for a
 *                  period of ~3-15 ms depending on the core frequency.
 *
 *                  According to USB 2.0 specification section 7.1.7.7,
 *                  "The remote wakeup device must hold the resume signaling
 *                  for at least 1 ms but for no more than 15 ms."
 *                  The idea here is to use a delay counter loop, using a
 *                  common value that would work over a wide range of core
 *                  frequencies.
 *                  That value selected is 1800. See table below:

 *                  * These timing could be incorrect when using code
